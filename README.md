Private repo for Hennge global internship coding challenge

### Mission 1: Write a Go program
It is compilable, fulfills all rules written in the direction. To make it run without any 'for' loop, I chose to use recursive function for looping processes. I understand that it would be a bit hard to see what's input and what's output in the terminal after the program is terminated, but since it's to be auto-tested I didn't add any line or words to hinder testing.


### Mission 2: Publish code as a secret gist
Done

### Mission 3: Send URL of the gist's link
I used a tool named 'Httpie'
